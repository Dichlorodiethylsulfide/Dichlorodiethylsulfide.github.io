    "Long Description":"In a newly created universe, war always finds its way inside. Races of all kinds take part. To achieve glory, to be recognised by those they worship. You must defend all species of the Xeno-Pantheon, to protect the sacred vessels that converse with your gods. Prophets and Messiahs alike. The Dryands invade to bring about their evil, wrong ways. Their machines are cold and heartless, so we must fight with our own. After all, fighting fire with fire is only wrong if their fire succeeds. As long as their soil is more scorched and charred than ours, then  our fight was worth it.<br><br> 'We smite you down with hellfire with the power of Gods you cannot even conceive of' - Uilenif Tentael, the Dark Seraphim, Herald of the Abyss.<br><br>Automated Abyss is a strategy game based on automation and the x86 instruction set (made in Unity). You must defend your outposts on this unknown world, fighting for control over the universe itself, as you attempt to conquer it all. You must deploy buildings to build up your outposts from the main building, the Clock all the way through resource generators like the Data Miner and defensive buildings like the Tower and Mortar. The Clock pulses like a CPU, allowing each building to execute its own instructions whether that be to control data flow, generate extra resources or shoot the enemies as they come.",

    "Case Study":
    {
      "Project Purpose":"Initially, the project was created as the main deliverable in a university assignment. However, it quickly grew into a separate game and education tool after it was handed in. This is because it contains various strategic gameplay elements along with a potential for endless replayability. It was published on Itch.io as part of the assignment but remained there for the foreseeable future as a game to be played by the masses as well as a testament to my programming ability. The educational aspects came as a result of how the game plays, with the game's main mechanic being focused on using custom-made assembly-like commands to run real-time strategy scenarios, it became apparent that this could not only be a fun, entertaining game but also a method of teaching how computers communicate on a very low programming level. After all, to fundamentally understand how computers work, outside of learning about binary, you must learn the computing language of Assembly.",
      "Workflow Approach":"My approach to making such a complex piece of programming and graphical design was to create a simplified version, a prototype, of what I wanted the end result to immitate. This was done by creating a 2D version of the game and implementing the main game mechanics, such as having the assembly commands be translated into movement of data between towers / buildings. After I created the proof of concept, I was able to build confidence and even greater dedication to finalising the project, creating what you see as the end result. All of this was accomplished in C# (made within Unity) and used a variety of programming paradigms and techniques.",
      "Positive Outcomes":"The project received extremely positive feedback, both from the examiners / markers of the project as well as from the university as a whole. I later even created a promotional video (included in the gallery) for the project as required by the university to send it off and share with prospective students. Personally, I also learnt a great deal more about C#, programming and game engines in general after creating this project, from tinkering with using separate threads to run commands to using unity's own coroutine system and even learning more about graphics (and making available the option to change graphics quality) and how to efficiently pass information between classes to ensure the game did not stutter when handling custom commands.",

    "Long Description":"Welcome To Polybius. The Battle of the Polygons has begun. The endless tower defense game plotting shapes against shapes. The Squares and Rectangles have teamed up against the rest of the shapes. They are sick of not being in the spotlight long enough. After all, Triangles and Circles get all the attention with their stability and π. But not any longer, the square-cube law will be used more often, the 4-sided polygons will rise up. Enemies have 12 levels. (red, blue, green, yellow, pink, purple, grey, black, white, zebra, rainbow, ceramic). The squares have managed to encase themselves in the shells of other squares, making higher levels more formiddable. You have to destroy each casing, over and over before reaching the centre and killing the square inside. But be careful, some enemies have special immunity to certain tower types and some enemies split up into more weaker enemies.",

There’s still some of your favourite left, cherry pie and ice-cream.' Chloe shook her head without making eye contact and continued to pick at what remained of her food with a loosely held fork. 'You alright Chloe?' asked her father, 'You look a little subdued this evening. Things okay at school? Homework getting you down?' Chloe fiddled with a few strands of her long blonde hair before looking Graham straight in the face. 'No, it’s not my homework, it’s what might happen while I’m doing it,' she stormed. Before her father had a chance to respond, she continued. 'Doesn’t it worry you, what happened to Sonja? This is the second night since she went missing. Her mum last saw her going to her bedroom to do schoolwork. How can anyone be abducted from their own room?' Graham nodded. 'Yes, I can see how that would concern you, but there’s likely to be more to it. From what I’ve heard, neither of her parents were actually at home when she disappeared.'",

The use of perlin noise may be implemented and compared later on but the current code uses custom geneation. The AI generator is much more simplified and creates several nodes across a 2D plane, moving the AI between those nodes at random intervals with added jerks and twitches, as well as attuning movement to when enemies approach.",

This was developed alongside the server farm revolution in technology, where big tech companies create nested virtual machine networks inside of very large server setups to allows as many people as possible the ability to use / take advantage of a server. This application, therefore, allows the server to send data to a listening client without needing to interact with the client itself. The client self-executes the commands based on parameters and additional data sent by the server. The biggest use of which would be to execute a collection of commands on all virtual machines at once.",
